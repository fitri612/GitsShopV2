# üßê Project philosophy

> Group 17 has designed a POS website under the name "Lemon Shop" as a Midterm Exam project in an Independent Study activity organized by PT Gits ID. This website is equipped with important features such as authentication (Login, Register), product management, product category management, shopping cart management, and transaction list.   In addition, the website is also equipped with additional features such as search, invoicing, and category filters that make the online shopping experience more convenient and easy for users.  With Lemon Shop, it is hoped that it will make it easier for casier to make transactions

# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- The Lemon Shop project uses the Laravel 9 development framework as a reliable and efficient development base. In addition, the use of Bootstrap technology, native CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and PHP is also used to enrich the appearance and functionality of the website.
